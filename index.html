<h1 style="background-color:Tomato" >love for music</h1>
<p>Music! something that everyone loves,and me who is just mad on music.I love music especially for these reasons,it makes me feel at peace . I listen to music everytime i get time,it is like a part of my body.Music is the language that doesn't speak in particular words.Music is the only one thing that can make me happy. I have this app called resso where i find all types of songs. It is hard to to pick a favourite music because i love all music so much.Music is a way to escape all my troubles behind for a while.My favourite singer is Arman Malik.I literally like all of his songs.I think that music is the essence of life. Music is everywhere . No matter how bad my day day goes ,music always makes me happy. .</p>
